# Inheritance

Inheritance is very complex topic in JavaScript, unlike most OO languages, where a simple keyword will allow us to inherit from a class, JS requires a series of steps in order to pass on public members in the same way. JS is one of the few languages that uses prototypal inheritance.

We need inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicate code and make objects as loosely coupled as possible.

#### Types of Inheritance 
- Classical inheritance (from Java. C++)
- Prototypal inheritance

## Mixin Classes

There is a way to reuse code without using strict inheritance. If a function needed to use in more than one class, it can be shared among multiple classes through augmentation.
